# ðŸ“ˆ AI-Powered Stock Market Insights
This is a Streamlit-based web application that provides a comprehensive analysis of a given stock ticker by combining historical data forecasting and real-time news sentiment analysis. The app uses a multi-layered approach to deliver a clear "BUY," "SELL," or "HOLD" recommendation.

## âœ¨ Features
- Historical Data Visualization: Displays the historical closing prices of any stock using interactive line charts.
- Prophet Forecasting: Utilizes Facebook's Prophet model to generate a long-term forecast and predict future price trends.
- LSTM Prediction: Employs a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to provide a next-day price prediction, offering a short-term outlook.
- Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of recent financial news headlines for the given stock ticker using the FinBERT model from the Hugging Face transformers library.
- Unified Recommendation: Synthesizes outputs from both forecasting models and the sentiment analysis to produce a final, actionable recommendation (BUY, SELL, or HOLD).
